#Introduction of thermal interface materials in LED lamps Application

1. WWhat is a thermal interface material?

• Thermal interface material, also known as thermal interface material or thermally conductive material, is a material commonly used for IC packaging and electronic heat dissipation. It is mainly used to fill the micro-voids and uneven holes on the surface when the two materials are joined or contacted. Reduce the thermal contact resistance of heat transfer and improve the heat dissipation performance of the device.
•Thermal interface (contact surface) materials (Thermal Interface Materials, TIM) play a very critical role in thermal management and are an important research branch in this discipline.

2. Why do we need thermal interface materials

• There is a very small uneven gap between the surface of the microelectronic material and the heat sink. If they are directly installed together, the actual contact area between them is only 10% of the base area of the heat sink, and the rest are air gaps. Because the air thermal conductivity is only (0.024W/(m·K), it is a poor conductor of heat, which will cause the contact resistance between the electronic components and the radiator to be very large, which seriously hinders the heat conduction and ultimately results in the efficiency of the radiator low.
• Use a thermal interface material with high thermal conductivity to fill these gaps, eliminate the air in them, and establish an effective heat conduction channel between the electronic components and the radiator, which can greatly reduce the contact thermal resistance, so that the role of the radiator can be fully exerted.

3. What is the ideal thermal interface material?
The characteristics of an ideal thermal interface material are:
(1) High thermal conductivity.
(2) High flexibility, to ensure that the thermal interface material can fully fill the gaps on the contact surface under the condition of lower installation pressure, and to ensure that the contact thermal resistance between the thermal interface material and the contact surface is small;
(3) Insulation;
(4) Easy to install and detachable;
(5) Wide applicability, can be used to fill small gaps as well as large gaps.

4. the introduction of several common thermal interface materials
1. Thermally conductive silicone grease
(1) Thermally conductive silicone grease is commonly known as thermal grease. The thermally conductive silicone grease is made of silicone as the main raw material and added with heat-resistant and thermally excellent materials to make a thermally conductive silicone grease-like compound.
(2) Advantages: High cost performance, the most common thermal conductive material in electronic heat dissipation.

Note: The operation is inconvenient. The general thermal paste will have silicone oil precipitated, and it will dry after a long time. It is not recommended to use the thermal paste for products with a long service life.

2. Thermally conductive silicone pad

A. Thermally conductive silicone sheet is a kind of thermally conductive medium material synthesized by special process with silica gel as the base material and various auxiliary materials such as metal oxides.
B. In the industry, it is also called thermally conductive silicone pad, thermally conductive silicon film, soft thermally conductive pad, etc. It is specially produced for the design scheme of transferring heat through the gap, which can fill the gap and complete the heat transfer between the heating part and the heat dissipation part. .
C. At the same time, it also plays the role of insulation, shock absorption, sealing, etc., which can meet the design requirements of equipment miniaturization and ultra-thinness. It is extremely manufacturable and usable, and has a wide range of thicknesses. It is an excellent thermal conductivity Filler.

# Advantages of thermally conductive silicone pad
1) The range and stability of the thermal conductivity of the thermally conductive silicone sheet
2) The thermal silica sheet bridges the process gap in the structure and reduces the process gap requirements of the radiator and the heat dissipation structure
3) Thermally conductive silicone sheet has insulating properties.
4) Thermally conductive silicone sheet has the effect of shock absorption and sound absorption.
5) The thermal conductive silicone sheet has the convenience of installation, testing, and reusability.

Thermally conductive phase change material
•Phase change material refers to a substance that changes shape with temperature changes and can provide latent heat. The process of a phase change material changing from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid is called a phase change process. At this time, the phase change material will absorb or release a large amount of latent heat.
•Advantages: The phase change material is now mainly solid-solid phase change. In the face of thermal shock, it can absorb a certain amount of heat through the phase change and slow the impact of large heat flux. It is like adding a water storage to the heat transfer channel Pool. The phase change temperature of the current phase change materials on the market is about 45 ℃-50 ℃. The phase change materials are mainly used in heat sources with instantaneous large heat fluxes such as CPUs, which can play a good protective role. , Especially at the moment of turning on or restarting. Note: There is a certain heat capacity and thermal resistance less than the thickness of the thermally conductive silicone sheet. The thickness can be 0.125mm. It is not easy to store and install. Silicone oil separates and affects the light effect of lighting Changing the heat transfer medium is more suitable for consumer electronics and other products, especially notebook computers, game consoles, etc. However, its reliability is not good, and its performance will decline at high temperatures for a long time. Generally used for 2 years, the performance will drop by about 40%-- -70%.

# Thermally conductive double-sided adhesive
• Thermally conductive double-sided adhesive, also known as thermally conductive tape, is made of acrylic polymer filled with thermally conductive ceramic powder and compounded with organic silicone adhesive. It has high thermal conductivity and insulation properties, and has softness, compressibility, conformability and strong adhesion. It can adapt to a large temperature range, can fill uneven surfaces, can tightly and firmly fit the heat source device and the heat sink, and quickly conduct heat away.
•Advantages: Generally, the usage of bonding other heat sinks and heating devices is very convenient. Place the thermally conductive double-sided paste between the heat sink and the heat sink, press it firmly, and the heat sink will be firmly fixed on the heat sink, easy to use Convenient and helpful to improve production efficiency. Its heat dissipation effect is more obvious than that of ordinary heat dissipation stickers, which greatly improves the life of the components. It is the first choice for some high-end electronic products that require heat conduction.
•Notes: High requirements on the bonded surface, printing and electroplating surfaces are not suitable.

# Thermally Conductive Graphite Sheet
• Thermally conductive graphite sheet is a brand-new thermal and heat dissipation material that conducts heat evenly in two directions, shielding heat sources and components, and improving the performance of consumer electronic products. It has high heat dissipation efficiency, small footprint, light weight, uniform heat conduction in two directions, eliminates "hot spot" areas, shields heat sources and components, and improves the performance of consumer electronic products.
• Advantages: high thermal conductivity, relatively thin materials, high cost performance, super longitudinal thermal conductivity, and can quickly eliminate hot spots.
• Points to note: no insulation, brittle material, large loss during punching.

Fifth, the choice of thermal interface materials for LED lamps.
1. LED street light: Different manufacturers have different designs. I have seen that some manufacturers do not use it, but it is not integrated lamp beads. The aluminum substrate and housing are required to be very flat. Some manufacturers use thermal paste and thermal silica gel. In the past two years, some manufacturers use thermal conductive graphite and solder paste.
Suggestion: Use graphite sheet and thermal silica sheet.
2. LED fluorescent lamp and panel lamp: It is best to use thermal conductive double-sided tape.
3. LED spotlights and downlights: thermally conductive insulating sheet (0.23mm withstand voltage 5kv), thermally conductive graphite sheet
